# Intent_Detection_chatbot
A simple chat bot to classify intents using SGD ML model


Intent detection with Machine Learning is significant because it is a critical component of natural language comprehension and helps machines to interpret and react to human language more naturally. Machine learning models may be taught to identify various purposes expressed in text or speech. It is challenging for conventional rule-based techniques to determine intent effectively due to differences and subtleties in language, such as synonyms, colloquialisms, and misspellings.

The project aims to develop a Python chatbot that can comprehend and react to user input using a variety of natural language processing (NLP) methods. The training set for the chatbot is produced by parsing the intent JSON file, preprocessing and lemmatizing the data, and classifying it. In order to predict the correct class for a given input, a model is then developed using a bag of words (BoW) and  SGD technique and trained on the data. The get response function and predict class are then used to construct the response. Python GUI was used to provide the responses.
